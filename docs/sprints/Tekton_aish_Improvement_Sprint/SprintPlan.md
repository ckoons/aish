# Tekton-aish Improvement Sprint Plan

## Executive Summary

This sprint implements five major improvements to the Tekton-aish interface, focusing on real-time streaming, session management, and enhanced AI orchestration capabilities. These improvements will transform aish from a request-response tool to a real-time, conversational AI orchestration platform.

## Sprint Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Streaming Responses** - Implement server-sent events (SSE) or WebSocket streaming for all AI responses
2. **Session Management** - Add stateful conversation support with context persistence
3. **Bulk Operations** - Enable efficient multi-AI pipeline execution
4. **Enhanced Discovery** - Provide detailed AI capability metadata
5. **WebSocket Support** - Real-time bidirectional communication

### Secondary Objectives
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing interfaces
- Improve error handling and recovery
- Add comprehensive monitoring and metrics
- Create migration guides for existing clients

- WebSocket libraries (websockets, python-socketio)
- Redis or similar for session storage
- Prometheus for metrics collection

### Human Resources
- 1 Architect Claude for design decisions
- 1-2 Working Claudes for implementation

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Streaming Compatibility**: Some AI models may not support streaming
  - *Mitigation*: Implement fallback to buffered responses
  
- **Session Storage Scale**: Large contexts could overwhelm storage
  - *Mitigation*: Implement aggressive pruning and compression

### Medium Risk
- **WebSocket Stability**: Connection drops could lose state
  - *Mitigation*: Implement reconnection with session recovery
  
- **Performance Impact**: New features could slow existing operations
  - *Mitigation*: Extensive performance testing and optimization

### Low Risk
- **API Breaking Changes**: Could affect existing clients
  - *Mitigation*: Versioned APIs with backward compatibility

## Success Metrics

1. **Streaming Performance**
   - First token latency < 100ms
   - Sustained streaming at 50+ tokens/second
   
2. **Session Management**
   - Context retention across 10+ exchanges
   - Session recovery < 1 second
   
3. **Bulk Operations**
   - 50% reduction in multi-AI pipeline latency
   - Support for 10+ parallel AI requests
   
4. **Discovery Enhancement**
   - Capability matching accuracy > 90%
