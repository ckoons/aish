# aish Development Sprints

This directory contains documentation for aish development sprints, following the Tekton Development Sprint methodology.

## Current Active Sprint

### [Tekton-aish Improvement Sprint](./Tekton_aish_Improvement_Sprint/)
**Status**: Ready for Implementation  
**Duration**: 14 days  
**Goals**: Implement streaming, sessions, bulk operations, enhanced discovery, and WebSocket support

Key improvements:
- Real-time streaming responses (< 100ms first token)
- Stateful conversations with context persistence
- 50% faster multi-AI pipelines via bulk operations
- Intelligent AI routing based on capabilities
- WebSocket support for interactive sessions

## Sprint Process

Each sprint follows a structured approach:

1. **Planning Phase**
   - Define goals and success criteria
   - Make architectural decisions
   - Create implementation plan

2. **Implementation Phase**
   - Build features with tests
   - Follow test-driven development
   - Document as you go

3. **Integration Phase**
   - End-to-end testing
   - Performance optimization
   - Documentation updates

## Sprint Documentation Structure

Each sprint directory contains:
- `README.md` - Sprint overview
- `SprintPlan.md` - Detailed timeline and phases
- `ArchitecturalDecisions.md` - Key design choices
- `ImplementationPlan.md` - Technical implementation
- `APISpecifications.md` - New/changed APIs
- `TestingStrategy.md` - Test plans
- `TestingImprovements.md` - Test infrastructure updates

## Contributing to Sprints

When working on a sprint:
1. Read all sprint documentation first
2. Follow the implementation plan
3. Write tests alongside features
4. Update documentation as you go
5. Report progress in status reports

## Past Sprints

No completed sprints yet - this is the first major aish sprint!

## Future Sprint Ideas
