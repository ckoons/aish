# aish Improvements Phase 4 Sprint

## Overview

This sprint implements client-side streaming support and improvements for aish, building on the Tekton streaming infrastructure.

## Sprint Goals

1. **SSE Client Implementation** - Display AI responses progressively
2. **Stream Wrapper** - Unified interface for all stream types
3. **Pipeline Improvements** - Fix timeouts and add context passing
4. **Enhanced History** - Stream-aware recording

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Users see AI responses as they're generated
- [ ] Pipeline commands work reliably without timeouts
- [ ] Context passes between pipeline stages
- [ ] History correctly records streaming sessions
- [ ] All existing features continue working

## Duration

7 days (after Tekton sprint completion)

## Prerequisites

- Tekton SSE endpoints implemented and working
- Team chat fixed in Rhetor
- MCP tools completed

## Key Deliverables

### 1. SSE Client
- Progressive output display in shell
- Reconnection handling
- Error recovery

### 2. Stream Wrapper
- Unified API for SSE/WebSocket/Socket
- Heartbeat management
- Backpressure handling

### 3. Pipeline Fixes
- Resolve timeout issues
- Add context passing
- Support parallel execution

### 4. History Enhancements
- Track partial responses
- Export streaming data
- Replay considerations

## Future Ideas Captured

From our discussion with Casey:
- Context preservation via pipelines
- Self-reflection patterns (AI analyzing its own output)
- Workflow replay with modifications
- Memory hints between resets

## Technical Context

- Current socket implementation uses line-buffered JSON
- History stored in `~/.aish_history` and `~/.aish/sessions/`
- Pipeline timeout issue in `_execute_pipe_stages()`
- All code in Python with Unix philosophy

## Next Steps

After this sprint, consider:
- WebSocket implementation (Phase 5)
- Engram integration for persistent memory
- Advanced pipeline patterns
- Performance optimizations
