# Phase 2 History Implementation Summary

## Completed ✅

### 1. Conversation History System
- Created `AIHistory` class in `src/core/history.py`
- Dual storage: text (`~/.aish_history`) and JSON (`~/.aish/sessions/`)
- Unix-style format with command numbers and AI responses
- Full integration with shell - automatically tracks all conversations

### 2. Shell Integration
- `history` command shows recent conversations
- `!number` replays commands from history (bash-style)
- Updated help system with history commands

### 3. aish-history Command
- Standalone tool for history management
- Supports search, replay, JSON export
- Works with `jq` for advanced processing
- Command: `aish-history --json | jq '.history[-5:]'`

### 4. Documentation
- Created comprehensive history documentation
- Added to main docs README
- Test documentation for history features

## Working Features ✅
1. **Single AI communication**: `echo "message" | athena`
2. **History recording**: All commands and responses saved
3. **History retrieval**: Via shell and aish-history command
4. **JSON export**: For programmatic access

## Known Issues ❌
1. **Pipeline feature**: `echo "test" | apollo | athena` - Apollo timeout issue
2. **Team chat**: Returns "No responses yet" - Likely Tekton/Rhetor issue

## Testing
- `test_history.py` - Core history functionality ✅
- `test_aish_features.py` - Feature-by-feature testing
- `test_history_live.py` - Live AI testing with real history

## Future Enhancement Ideas
As Casey noted: Pipelines could carry context/memory between AI resets:
```bash
# Remind AI of previous context
engram --get "last-response" | apollo

# Self-reflection
apollo --history | echo "You said this, please elaborate" | apollo
```

## Next Steps
1. Debug pipeline timeout issue (might be in socket communication)
2. Work with Tekton team on team-chat functionality
3. Consider adding context-passing features to pipelines
